## Performance Analyzer RCA

The Performance Analyzer RCA is a framework that builds on the Performance Analyzer engine to support Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of performance and reliability problems in Elasticsearch clusters. This framework executes real time root cause analyses using Performance Analyzer metrics. Root cause analysis can significantly improve operations, administration and provisioning of Elasticsearch clusters, and it can enable Elasticsearch client teams to tune their workloads to reduce errors.
